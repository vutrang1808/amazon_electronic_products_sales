# Amazon Electronics Products Sales
This notebook demonstrates a step-by-step sale analysis concerning a dataset of dimension 1.3M x 10. My solution is written in `Python` and utilizes `Pandas` as well as `Matplotlib` to visualize results.

To that end, I aim to answer these questions:
- What are the categories of electronic products? and Find the Top-10 users that bought mostly in each category
- Sales in a certain year groupped by categories
- Given a brand, find out in which categories it has products
- In which categories is the market competition at highest.

A logical approach is followed; after each step, a short insight into the dataset is given.

The dataset concerns electronic sales between 1999 and 2018 from Amazon.
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edusanketdk/electronics/data).
